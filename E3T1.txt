GuardDuty detected that brute force attacks were being made from IP 205.185.121.104 against Web Server Instance.
It gives information about how the attacks are being made - on port 22 using SSH protocol
It also shows which instance is being targeted by attackers - in this case the Web server instance, and it shows details about network connections of this instance - vpc, subnet that it is in, the security group attached to it, the network ACL attached to the VPC and also route table.


GuardDuty analyses tens of thoudsands of AWS events across multiple data sources like DNS Flow logs, VPC flow logs and CloudTrail logs.
Since we do not have CloudTrail set up for this EC2 instance, its obvious that GuardDuty got its info from the VPC flow logs and understood that a brute force attack is being made on the web server instance.
